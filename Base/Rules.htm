<ol>
<li> No Bullying, Trolling, incessant Flaming, Auto'ing, or Metagaming of any sort is to be tolerated.</li>

<li> Actions that usually require IC lead-up such as mating may not be performed OOCly. (This becomes a Major Offense if performed by a Lust Demon)</li>

<li> Roleplay actions must begin with a beginning emote (giving a general gist of what the player is doing) and end with a resulting emote (Giving the results of the roleplay actions) This includes IC fighting and killing. Killing requires a countdown and is a major offense.</li>

<li> You may NEVER non-rp attack or non-rp kill against a player character, nor may you soul steal or take RP actions against an AFK player character. </li>

<li>  All characters must have an IC name that follows roleplay naming rules. Roleplay naming rules allow any name that is not 'leetspeak', 'netspeak', gang names, names taken out of context of the roleplay, or obvious troll names. </li>

<li> No blatant and incessant arguing with the admin staff. If you have an issue, be a gentleman about it rather than starting a flame war.</li>
