<div align="center"><h3> Admin Rules </h3></div>
<ol>
<li> An admin or moderator may never flame, troll, or bully a player</li>

<li> An admin or moderator may never have a personal agenda dealing against the player base and any player  in general.</li>

<li> An admin or moderator may never shirk his duties so long as he is available on the game, and must always help the players if he can.</li>

<li> If an issue deals with the entire player-base it must be dealt with and discussed in public eye. This does not mean OOC, but can be anything the public has access to.</li>

<li> Admins and moderators are to be treated fairly as if players.</li>
